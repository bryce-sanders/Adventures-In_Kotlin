# Overview

This project marks my very first venture into the use of the Kotlin programming language. In completing this project, I have the opportunity, not only to learn a very marketable and widely used programming language, but also to demonstrate that I can pick up the basics of new coding languages quickly.

The program will ask the user if they want to calculate the volume of a sphere or a cone and get measurements from the user. It will then calculate the volume of those shapes. The user will be asked to continually enter shapes and measurements until they decline to enter any more.

I am undertaking this project to help me to further my academic progress.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
