# Overview

This project marks my very first venture into the use of the Kotlin programming language. In completing this project, I have the opportunity, not only to learn a very marketable and widely used programming language, but also to demonstrate that I can pick up the basics of new coding languages quickly.

The program will ask the user if they want to calculate the volume of a sphere or a cone and get measurements from the user. It will then calculate the volume of those shapes. The user will be asked to continually enter shapes and measurements until they decline to enter any more.

I am undertaking this project to help me to further my academic progress.

# Development Environment

This program was developed in the IntelliJ IDE.

The program is written in Kotlin and makes use of Java's math library.

# Useful Websites

The following sites were helpful in working with Kotlin:
* [Fireship channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT8oP0wy-A0) A very good overview of the "what" and "why" behind Kotlin
* [FreeCodeCamp.org channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9UC9DY-vIU) A great tutorial on installing the IntelliJ IDE
* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/class-objects) A good explaination of creating classes with Kotlin

# Future Work

Things I would like to work on or add in the future:
* Seperate classes into their own files
* Modify the program to use collections
* Make the program an app instead of running in the terminal
